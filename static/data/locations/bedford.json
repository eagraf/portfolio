        "I grew up in the small town of Bedford, Massachusetts, sandwiched between historic Lexington and Concord. There, I attended Bedford High School, graduating in the class of 2017.",
        "My interests changed a lot as I grew up, but by my Junior year I decided for sure that I wanted to study computer science. In my senior year, I worked as a course assistant for Harvard's CS50 course, and as a web developer for a startup in Cambridge.",
        "The summer after graduating high school, I worked as a DevOps intern at 18moons, a startup company building a childhood media platform."
